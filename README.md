QUANTUM COMPUTATION OF HYDRIDE ION USING VARIATIONAL QUANTUM ALGORITHM
= Because of remarkable reactivity and strong electron-electron
correlation effects, the precise prediction and comprehen-
sion of molecular energy and chemical reactivity of hydride
ion is an essential objective in quantum chemistry. Lever-
aging variational quantum algorithms offers a promising av-
enue for studying molecular properties using current noisy
intermediate-scale quantum devices. This work utilises the
variational approach to anticipate the ground state, reac-
tivity, and single-electron detachment energy of the three-
body hydride ion. We investigated both Hardware-Efficient
Ansatz (HEA) and Chemistry-inspired ansatz based on a Uni-
tary Coupled Cluster (UCC) on both noiseless and noisy
IBM Simulator. Modern error-mitigating techniques, such
as Zero-Noise Extrapolation (ZNE) with unitary folding and
measurement error mitigation, have been implemented to
significantly reduce errors in noisy environments. This study
contributes to our understanding of the quantum computa-
tional nuances of the hydride ion and addresses the ques-
tion of whether quantum computers can retain the correla-
tion energies for these correlated ions.
